hansbot.py
======
**hansbot.py** is a really crummy Slack bot. Use it like this:

```
source environment.sh
nohup ./slackbot.py &
```

But first you'll need to put your Slack developer token into the environment.sh file.

System state is maintained across power cycling, etc. via a SQLite-backed dict.

## Version

In perpetual beta.

## Contact

Talk to the bot.
